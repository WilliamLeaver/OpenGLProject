# OpenGLProject
This is an office scene created using OpenGL and C++

- How do I approach designing software?

I design software with the user in mind. When I go to add a feature, how the user will interact witht that feature is always top of mind. This helps save on future time spent on QOL changes or bug fixes

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has helped enhance my ability to organize code. This larger scale project has taught me to be more organized with my code in order to help readablity as well as troubleshooting.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?

For this project I followed a trial and error design process. This did save on planning time, but may have taken more time overall. 

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Planning to be organized from the start and doing a better planning stage will help me with projects in the future. 

- How do I approach developing programs?

Programs are most often tools for users. These should be bug free and should enhance a users QOL.

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

While working on my 3D scene I used meshes to create different objects and string them together to make a more complex object. 

- How did iteration factor into your development?

Each frame is one iteration of what is on screen. This is mainly seen when switching from ortho to perspective and seeing the lights change as the frames update. 

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

At first I was manually plotting out and drawling the line within the program. While this worked at first when creating one or two objects, when you get to making many objects you need a class that can build objects and then translate them to where they should be on the scene. 

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me reach my goals by giving me the ability to enhance the QOL of myself and other both in a perfessional and personal setting.
